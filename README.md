# 🎮 TicTacToe AI — Unbeatable with Pygame

Welcome to **TicTacToe AI**, a Python game built using **Pygame** where you play against an **unbeatable AI**. Powered by the **Minimax algorithm**, this AI ensures that it **never loses**—every game ends in either a **win for the AI** or a **draw**.

## 🧠 Features

* 🎯 **Perfect AI**: The AI uses Minimax to play optimally — you can’t beat it.
* 🖱️ **Interactive GUI**: Built with Pygame for a smooth graphical experience.
* 🔁 **Replay Option**: Play multiple rounds without restarting the app.
* 🧠 **Clean Code**: Separated logic for game, AI, and UI.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* Pygame

### 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pranav-Conova/Tictactoe
   cd Tictactoe
   ```

2. Install Pygame (if not installed):

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python runner.py
   ```

## 🎲 How to Play

* The game window will open using Pygame.
* You will play as **X** and the AI will play as **O** (or vice versa).
* Click on a tile to make your move.
* The AI will automatically respond.
* After the game ends (win/draw), you can choose to restart.

## 🧠 How the AI Works

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, which explores all possible game outcomes and always chooses the best possible move. The logic guarantees that the AI:

* Wins if the opponent makes a mistake.
* Forces a draw if the player plays optimally.
